# LearningC

<br>

```lex
LearningC is a repository with Examples, Exams and Tasks from PROG1001 at NTNU.
It contains code made by our lecturer and code I have done myself. Including obligatory submissions.

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > All tasks "Hefteoppgaver" are based on my own interpretation, they should only be used as a reference and not the correct answer.

You are free to use the code as you wish. There is no such thing as my code or your code. It's ours <3
